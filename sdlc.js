// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = `This is the second step, where developers define objectives, project goals, and function/operations of the app. At the end of this phase there is typically a document called Software Requirement Specification (SRS) that will assist in the rest of the stages.`

const design = `This is the third step, where using the SRS the system and software design is prepared. Outlined details and specifics are used to prepare a design document to be referenced throughout the next phases.`

const implementation = `This is the fourth step, in which work is divided into units and coding begins.`
